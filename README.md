# sigma-edit-v2

Improved version of https://github.com/longwatermelon/sigma-edit. Generated videos are posted [here](https://www.youtube.com/@BasedSigmaCentral).

To run this, download the full `res` folder [here](https://drive.proton.me/urls/JMTVXYR01M#ItgiqQWGJiaE).

Some old formats have been broken because their video files have accidentally been erased. These formats don't perform well on YouTube anyways, though.

Implemented formats so far:
* Edit (Bateman, Shelby, anime)
* Meme compilation
* Comparison
* Quiz
* Conspiracy theories
